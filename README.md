<h1>Tem Cmdr</h1>

Tem Cmdr is a command execution script for Roblox because I got bored with javascript.

Command prefix: ";"

```lua
-- to load the thingy lol
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ITemply/temCmdr/main/main.lua'))()
```

<h2>Commands</h2>

1. <b>;setStatus</b> (true/false) - sets the status of the bot to be active or non-active (can not be undone once false)
2. <b>;bringClient</b> - brings the client to the command executor
3. <b>;signSay</b> (message) - brings the client to the command executor holding a sign with a message
4. <b>;hideSign</b> - hides the sign
